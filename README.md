There are 3 folders : 
 
 - Simulations_LTM : scripts in R and Python to build a Liability Threshold Model with genotypes of individuals.
 - Simulations_LTM_simulated_data : script in R to show the effect of the number of cases on the AUC.
 - Simulations_UKB : scripts in R to show the effect of the number of SNPs on the AUC with individual data. Data are from the UKBiobank cohort, so they are not available here but on their website with the right permissions.
